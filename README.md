# Lunar-Lander-Test-Vehicle-Model
This is a miniature model of the Lunar Lander Test Vehicle from the 1960's. This is an experimental set up to understand the working of thrust vectoring used while landing on the moon. 

The electronic components used for the LLTV are:
1. Arduino Nano
2. MPU6050 (Accelorometer & Gyro sensor)
3. nRF24L01 for Telemetry 
4. MG90 Servo motors for x & y axis
5. DC-DC Buck converter
6. Li-Po 11.1v Battery

The electronic components used for the Base station are:
1. Arduino UNO
2. nRF24L01 for Telemetry
